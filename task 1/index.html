    <h1>Indian 78th Independence Day Celebration</h1>
    <p>A significant day in Indian history is August 15, 1947, which fell on this date. 
        After many years of arduous battle and many sacrifices made by the Indian freedom warriors,
         it was the happiest day of 1947 when India gained its independence.</p>

        About Indian Army
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Indian Army is the land-based branch of the Indian Armed Forces.
         It is the world's second-largest standing army and the largest army. 
        The President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Army,
         and it is commanded by the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), who is a four-star general.

      <p>
        The Indian army is the bravest and second largest army in the world with a total of 1.23 million soldiers. 
        The Ministry of Defence of the Government of India is the governing body for the Indian Armed Forces. 
        Commanded by the President of India as the supreme commander and commanded by the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), 
        the Indian Army fulfils the aim of safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country. 
      </p>
      <p>General K.M. Cariappa, the first Indian commander-in-chief of the Indian Army, 
        replaced British Commanding General Sir Francis Butcher and formed the Territorial Army in 1949, 
        transforming the British Army into a national one. </p>
        <p>From the date of replacement, the Indian Army didn’t look back.
           Whether in signing any pact with a country across the border or safeguarding the nation from internal or external threats, 
           the Indian Army always marked success. 
          It successfully maintained peace and security within the country’s frame. </p>

    <h1 id="History">History of Our Independence Day</h1>
    <img src="/image/history of inde.webp" style="height:80vh; width: 60%; " alt="--" class="py-3" >
    <p>One of the most memorable days in Indian history is 15th August. 
      It’s the day on which the Indian sub-continent got independence after a long struggle.
       India only has three national festivals that are celebrated by the whole nation as one. 
       One being the Independence Day (15th August) and the other two being Republic Day (26th January) and Gandhi Jayanti (2nd October). 
       After independence, India became the largest democracy in the world. We fought very hard to get our independence from the Britishers. 
      In this essay on Independence Day, we are going to discuss the history and importance of Independence Day.</p>
    <p>For almost two centuries the Britishers ruled over us. And the citizen of the country suffered a lot due to these oppressors. 
      British officials treat us like slaves until we manage to fight back against them.</p>
      <p>We struggled for our independence but work tirelessly and selflessly under the guidance of our leaders Jawahar Lal Nehru, 
        Subhash Chandra Bose, Mahatma Gandhi, Chandra Shekhar Azad, and Bhagat Singh. 
        Some of these leaders choose the path of violence while some choose non-violence. 
        But the ultimate aim of these was to drive out the Britishers from the country. 
        And on 15th August 1947, the long-awaited dream come true.</p>

          This year, in 2024, it will be falling on a Thursday, August 15, under the theme, 
          ‘Viksit Bharat,’ reflecting the current government’s vision of transforming India into a developed nation by 2047, 
          as it will coincide with 100 years of independence.
        </p>
        <p>Marking the historic day in 1947, the first Prime Minister of Independent India, Jawaharlal Nehru, 
          delivered a speech on the eve of Independence—Tryst with Destiny. In this momentous address, he proclaimed, 
          “At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom,” 
          capturing the struggle and happiness of the newly independent India.</p>
